# Predictive Modeling of Property Values: A Data Mining Approach

## Overview
This project utilizes linear regression to predict property values, showcasing the process from data preparation to model application. It's an exploration into how data mining techniques can be effectively applied in real estate valuation.

## Contents
- **Data Preparation:** Initial steps to clean and prepare the property listings dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visual and statistical techniques to understand the data's underlying patterns and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques employed to enhance the dataset and improve model performance.
- **Model Building:** Development of a linear regression model to predict property values.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessment of the model's performance using validation datasets.
- **Making Predictions:** Application of the model to predict values for new property listings.

## Usage
The notebook is structured to guide users through each step of the predictive modeling process, with code snippets and explanations provided for each section.
